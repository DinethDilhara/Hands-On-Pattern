Engaging with pattern questions not only sharpens our cognitive abilities but also enhances our problem-solving strategies and fosters a deeper understanding of logical relationships. 🧠💡

<font color="green"><b>What are pattern questions?</b></font>

A pattern question is like a puzzle where you need to figure out a hidden rule in a sequence of things, like numbers or shapes. Then, based on that rule, you have to predict what comes next or fill in what's missing. It's all about spotting the pattern and using it to solve the problem.

- Identify the underlying rule or pattern governing the sequence.
- Predict the next element in the sequence based on the observed pattern.
- Fill in the missing element(s) within the sequence.
- Recognize relationships between elements in the sequence.

To simplify pattern questions, it's essential to understand repetitive and nested repetitive loops. We typically use for loops because they're well-suited for handling patterns due to their count control nature. With for loops, we can easily repeat actions a specific number of times, making them ideal for solving these types of questions. ✨🔍🔢
